	<h2>About us</h2>

	<p class="simple-text">
		Runner up's ambition is to offer consumers a fantastic service. You can rest assured that we are always on your side as a consumer in the online jungle of retailers and products. We love what we do and are incredibly proud to help people make wise decisions and save a lot of money – every day of the year.
		<br><br>
		We are a team of 129 ambitious Runner ups who work to develop the best service for comparison shopping. Runner up is completely independent; we are not owned by or dependent on any manufacturer, retailer or other organisation that might have an interest in providing biased information.
		<br><br>
		Runner up's mission is to help consumers find better products and better prices. Every month we help hundreds of thousands of consumers to find better, cheaper products and save money by comparing prices for a particular product.
		<br><br>
		Our vision is to be an independent, credible source the consumer can always rely on when they compare products online. We think what we do is really exciting – e-commerce is growing by over 15% a year and we want to continue helping shoppers make wiser decisions!
